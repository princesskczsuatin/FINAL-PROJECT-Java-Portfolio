# Laboratory Activity #6 – Modeling a School Management System

This laboratory activity extends the Smart Home concept by demonstrating runtime polymorphism through multiple device subclasses. Each device provides its own implementation of status display behavior using method overriding.
The system uses an abstract parent class to define common behavior while allowing each device to exhibit unique functionality. Devices are controlled collectively using arrays of the parent type.

The following Java concepts are applied in this activity:
- Abstract classes
- Runtime polymorphism
- Method overriding
- Parent-type collections
