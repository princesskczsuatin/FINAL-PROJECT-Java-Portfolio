# Laboratory Activity #5 – School Management System

This laboratory activity models a simple School Management System using inheritance and aggregation. The system show people in a school environment through a base `Person` class, with specialized roles such as `Student` and `Teacher`.
While students inherit shared properties from the `Person` class, teachers are linked to one or more courses through aggregation. The program shows how to initialize inherited attributes using constructors and the `super` keyword.

The following Java concepts are applied in this activity:
- Inheritance using the `extends` keyword
- IS-A and HAS-A relationships
- Aggregation between related classes
- Constructors and multilevel relationships
