# Midterm Laboratory Examination

The creation of a Smart Home Management System, which simulates different smart gadgets in a home setting, is the focus of this midterm lab test. Common behavior is inherited by devices like thermostats and lightbulbs from a parent `Device` class.
By keeping many device objects in a single array of the parent type and calling override methods during runtime, the application exhibits polymorphism.

The following Java concepts are applied in this activity:
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Polymorphism and dynamic binding
- Static members and shared behavior
