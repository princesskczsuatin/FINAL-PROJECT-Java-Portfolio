# Laboratory Activity #1 – Java Programming Review

Through the creation of a console-based Campus Library Book Management System, this lab exercise focuses on covering basic Java programming ideas. The application mimics a simple library setting in which user input controls and arrays are used to handle book records. The user may view all registered books, add book titles, update each book's status, and create a summary report of the books that are available and borrowed. To guarantee software stability and proper user engagement, input validation is used.

The following Java concepts are applied in this activity:
- Arrays for data storage
- Loops and conditional statements for program flow
- Methods for modular and reusable code
- Scanner class for user input handling
