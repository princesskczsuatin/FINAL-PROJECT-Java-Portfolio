# Laboratory Activity #1 – Java Programming Review

This laboratory activity focuses on reviewing fundamental Java programming concepts through the development of a console-based Campus Library Book Management System. The program simulates a basic library environment where book records are managed using arrays and controlled through user input.
The system allows the user to add book titles, update the status of each book, display all registered books, and generate a summary report of available and borrowed books. Input validation is implemented to ensure program stability and correct user interaction.

The following Java concepts are applied in this activity:
- Arrays for data storage
- Loops and conditional statements for program flow
- Methods for modular and reusable code
- Scanner class for user input handling
