# Laboratory Activities #3 and #4 – Coffee Shop Rewards System

This laboratory activity implements a Coffee Shop Rewards System designed to manage customer reward points and redemptions. Customers may get points through purchases and redeem rewards once sufficient points are accumulated.
The system supports both default and parameterized constructors, allowing flexible customer creation. Static members are used to track the total number of registered customers, while instance methods manage individual reward points and redemptions.

The following Java concepts are applied in this activity:
- Default and parameterized constructors
- Use of the `this` keyword
- Static variables and static methods
- Object interaction and method invocation
