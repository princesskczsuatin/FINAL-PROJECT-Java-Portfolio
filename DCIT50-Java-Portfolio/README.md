# Overview

The whole collection of lab exercises created for DCIT 50: Object-Oriented Programming with Java is available in this repository. The present collection intended to illustrate how to learn Java programming in a systematic manner, beginning with basic grammar and control structures and moving on to object-oriented design, abstraction, polymorphism, and graphical user interface creation.

To clearly record the goals, program behavior, and Java ideas used, each lab exercise is arranged into its own folder and contains a README.md file. Clarity, maintainability, and simplicity of assessment are guaranteed by this framework.
