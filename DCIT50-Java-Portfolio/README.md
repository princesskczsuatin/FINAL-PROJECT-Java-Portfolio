# Overview

This repository contains the complete set of laboratory activities developed for the course DCIT 50 – Object-Oriented Programming using Java. The purpose of this compilation is to demonstrate progressive learning in Java programming, starting from fundamental syntax and control structures and advancing toward object-oriented design, abstraction, polymorphism, and graphical user interface development.

Each laboratory activity is organized into a separate folder and includes its own README.md file to clearly document the objectives, program behavior, and Java concepts applied. This structure ensures clarity, maintainability, and ease of evaluation.
