# Laboratory Activity #7 – Order Management System

This laboratory activity implements an Order Management System for an online store. The system emphasizes abstraction and encapsulation by defining common order behavior through an abstract class and implementing payment functionality using an interface.
Order status is managed using an enumeration, while collections and iterators are used to safely manage multiple orders.

The following Java concepts are applied in this activity:
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Encapsulation using access modifiers
- Enumerations for fixed states
- Packages, collections, and iterators
