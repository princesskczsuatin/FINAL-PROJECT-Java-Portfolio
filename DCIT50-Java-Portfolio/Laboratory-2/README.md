# Laboratory Activity #2 – Working with Java Classes and Objects

This lab activity demonstrates object-oriented programming thoughts through the creation and management of book objects using a bespoke `Book` class. Every book has features like the title, author, year of release, and current page. 
The program shows how to create, modify, and retrieve objects using methods. Additionally, it includes activities like editing book data, changing page numbers, and filtering books based on the year of release.

The following Java concepts are applied in this activity:
- Class and object creation
- Constructors
- Encapsulation through private fields
- Getter and setter methods
- Arrays of objects and enhanced for-loops
