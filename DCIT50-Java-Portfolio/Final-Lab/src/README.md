The implementation of a Java Swing-based To-Do List application is the focus of this final lab test. Through a graphical user interface, the system permit users to create and manage tasks. Status indicators are used to track task progress.
The program separates the logic, data, and display layers using a reduced MVC framework and adheres to object-oriented design principles.

The following Java concepts are applied in this activity:
- Java Swing GUI development
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
